After successfully completing your mission by fighting off
the evil Kana, you now decide it is time to fly back to earth
and be idolized by your imaginary fans.

But maybe your victory will be short lived if you just so
happen to have a school test tomorrow on Japanese Kana, but
you have been too lazy to practise writing the characters!
-
Nonetheless, the game's author would like to thank you
for playing and looks forward to receiving any good
(or bad) feedback about the game.

His E-mail address is in the readme file which came with this game.

Just another one of those text documents which you probably never
bother to read anyway.
