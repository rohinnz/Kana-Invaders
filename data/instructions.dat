Your mission is to defend earth from the evil Kana invaders.

Destroy all approaching Kana by entering their romanji
equivalent. Move your ship under the kana and then quickly
type the romanji when prompted.

If you enter the correct romanji the Kana will be destoryed
and you will earn 5 points. If you fail to destory the Kana
and it leaves the bottom of the screen, you will have 10
points deducted from your score.

Try to complete all 30 levels and memorize all the Hiragana
and Katakana characters' romanji and pronunciation.
