# Kana Invaders
An educational game for teaching the Japanese Hiragana and Katakana using a repetitive approach.

You must quickly enter each Kana's romanji when it falls from the top of the screen. By the time you have completed all 30 levels you will know the romanji and pronunciation for every Kana character.

*NOTE: This project is quite old and was last updated in 2009. I plan rewrite it in Rust in the near future.*
