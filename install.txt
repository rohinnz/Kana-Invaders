 Requirements
 ============

 To compile Kana Invaders, you will need the following:

 Compilers and tools:
 * GNU C++ Compiler (MinGW if compiling under Windows)
 * SCons (v1.2.0 or greater) - http://www.scons.org/
 * Python (v1.5.2 or greater) - http://www.python.org/download/

 C++ Libraries:
 * SDL			http://www.libsdl.org/
 * SDL_image		http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
 * SDL_ttf		http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
 * SDL_mixer		http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/



 Installing under Windows
 ========================

 To compile Kana Invaders using bloodshed Dev-C++, do the following:

  1.  Download and run the Automated MinGW Installer for Windows from
      http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435
      Make sure the g++ and the windows api get select for installation.

  2.  Download and setup the following SDL libraries in MinGW:
      * SDL
      * SDL_image
      * SDL_ttf
      * SDL_mixer

      Lazy Foo' Productions has some good tutorials on setting up SDL for MinGW:
      http://lazyfoo.net/SDL_tutorials/lesson01/windows/mingw/index.php

  3.  Download and install Python: http://www.python.org/download/

  4.  Download and install scons http://www.scons.org/

  5.  In a console window go to the win32-build directory with the SConstruct file
      and type 'scons'.

      If this fails because scons is not found in the PATH variable, you may neeed to
      type something like 'C:\Python26\Scripts\scons'



 Installing under Linux
 ======================

 Use your package manager to download and install:
  * C/C++ (Usually already installed)
  * SDL libraries
  * Python
  * SCons

  In a console window go to the linux-build directory with the SConstruct file
  and type 'scons'



 Installing under Mac OS
 =======================

 Has yet to be compiled for Mac OS.
