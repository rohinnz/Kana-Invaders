                    RELEASE NOTES for Kana Invaders
==========================================================================

  Kana Invaders is an edutainment game for learning the Japanese

  Hiragana and Katakana. 

  This game attempts to teach the Japanese Kana using a repetitive

  approach by introducing 5 (or sometimes 3) new Kana Characters at each

  level. By the time you have completed all 30 levels you should have

  memorized the romanji and pronunciation for all Japanese Kana 
  characters.
